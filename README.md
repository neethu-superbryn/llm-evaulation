Simulate interactions, analyze performance, and gain actionable insights for conversational agents. Test, evaluate, and optimize your agent to ensure reliable real-world deployment.

IntellAgent is an advanced multi-agent framework that transforms the evaluation and optimization of conversational agents. By simulating thousands of realistic, challenging interactions, IntellAgent stress-tests agents to uncover hidden failure points. These insights enhance agent performance, reliability, and user experience.

### Key Features

- üî¨ **Generate Thousands of Edge-Case Scenarios:**  
  Automatically generate highly realistic edge-case scenarios tailored specifically to your agent.

- ü§ñ **Simulate Diverse User Interactions:**  
  Evaluate your agent across a wide spectrum of scenarios with varying complexity levels.

- üìä **Comprehensive Performance Evaluations:**  
Access detailed analysis to identify performance gaps, prioritize improvements, and compare outcomes across experiments.

- üåê **User-Friendly Web Interface:**  
  Upload your agent prompt, configure settings, and view results through an intuitive web dashboard.

- üí™ **Simple integration:**  
  Simple integration to your conversational agent.

## How it works
![simulator_recording](./docs/figures/overview.gif)
IntellAgent framework consists of three steps:
- Given the user prompt (and optional additional information such as tools and database schema)
  - The system decomposes the prompt into a policy graph.
  - It samples a subset of policies based on their concurrence in real conversation distributions.
  - It generates a scenario of user-chatbot interaction (including system databases) to address the selected subset of policies.
- Simulating the user-chatbot interaction using a user agent.
- Critiquing the conversation and providing feedback on the tested policies.
> To better understand the key concepts and how the IntellAgent system operates, refer to the [system overview guide](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/How_it_Works/how-it-works/)

## :fire: Quickstart

> For a more detailed and comprehensive guide, see the [Start Guide](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/quick_start/installation/).

### üåê Web Interface (Recommended for New Users)

The easiest way to get started is with our web interface:

```bash
# 1. Check if everything is set up correctly
python health_check.py

# 2. Configure your API keys
python setup_api_keys.py

# 3. Launch the web interface
python launch_web_interface.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` and follow the guided setup!

üìñ **[Web Interface Guide](WEB_INTERFACE_README.md)** | üìù **[Example Usage](examples/web_interface_example.md)**

### üñ•Ô∏è Command Line Interface

IntellAgent requires `python >= 3.9`
<br />

#### Step 1 - Download and install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:plurai-ai/intellagent.git
cd intellagent
```

You can use Conda or pip to install the dependencies.

Using pip: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### Step 2 - Set your LLM API Key

Edit the `config/llm_env.yml` file to set up your LLM configuration (OpenAI/Azure/Vertex/Anthropic):

```yaml
openai:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: "your-api-key-here"
```

To change the default LLM provider or model for either the IntellAgent system or the chatbot, you can easily update the configuration file. For instance, modify the `config/config_education.yml` file:


```yaml
llm_intellagent:
    type: 'azure'

llm_chat:
    type: 'azure'
```

To change the number of samples in the database you should modify the `num_samples` in the config file:
```yaml
dataset:
    num_samples: 30
```

> **Tokens Usage**
> 
> We invest lots of effort in minimizing the total cost of running the simulator 
> - Using the default parameters, the expected cost per sample is approximately $0.10
> - You can control expenses by modifying the `cost_limit` limit parameter in the config file
> - We are working on leveraging user data which will significantly reduce the cost per sample

####  Step 3 - Run the Simulator
If you're utilizing Azure OpenAI services for the `llm_intellagent`, ensure you [disable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/content-filters) the default `jailbreak` filter before running the simulator.

For fast simple environment without a database, run the following command:
```bash
python run.py --output_path results/education --config_path ./config/config_education.yml 
```
For more complex (slower) environment with a database, run the following command:
```bash
python run.py --output_path results/airline --config_path ./config/config_airline.yml 
```

> **Troubleshooting**  
> - **Rate limit messages** ‚Üí Decrease `num_workers` variables in the `config_default` file.  
> - **Frequent timeout errors** ‚Üí Increase the `timeout` values in the `config_default` file.


Explore the [Customization](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/customization/custom_environment/) options to configure the simulation for your environment, or delve into the [examples](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/examples/education/) we provide to learn more about its capabilities.
#### Step 4 - See the Results

To visualize the simulation results using streamlit, run:
```bash 
streamlit run simulator/visualization/Simulator_Visualizer.py
```
This will launch a[ Streamlit dashboard](./README.md#-demo) showing detailed analytics and visualizations of your simulation results.
